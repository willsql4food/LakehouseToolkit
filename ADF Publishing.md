### Notes
npm package @microsoft/azure-data-factory-utilities does NOT use ARM Templates generated by ADF Publish; rather, it builds templates from source files.

## Global Parameters causing issues deploying to various environments
* Things to try:
    * Check 'Include global parameters in ARM Template' - this adds a `globalParameters/<data factory name>_GlobalParameters.json` file 
        * May need to create that file each any deployment target factory
    * `factory` folder contains `<data factory name>.json` file, which contains global parameters definitions & values _regardless_ of checkbox setting.
    * Consider disallowing publish from ADF itself (in Git configuration, may require disconnecting and reconnecting from source control)
